# A Brief Background

As a programmer with an engineering mindset, I've always been fascinated with the
_process_ of communicating, and of written communication in particular.  From
plain text to nroff and TeX, to Microsoft Word and HTML/CSS, and now to Markdown
and Textile, the state of the art has meandered almost full circle.

_... TODO (CI/CD? GitHub/collaboration)..._

And now I find myself volunteering to manage the updating and publishing of a
"special-interest group"-style publication.  Not because I am a subject-matter
expert, but because I know a lot about process and technology.  The goal is to
take a once-self-published book and bring it back to life; removing the chains
of proprietary formatting and software, and making it easily updatable and
publishable.

Markdown is a fantastic format for simple-to-moderately-complex documents.  It
supports just enough formatting for what you need 95% of the time.  For a full
book, however, you need callouts, asides, an index and other cross-references,
and perhaps a bibliography.  Following Knuth's example of the _TeXbook_,
_Advanced Markdown and Processing for Book Publishing_ will show you how to use
Markdown and other tools to all of those things, and more.
